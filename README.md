# Scientific Computing with Python

Welcome to my GitHub repository showcasing the work I've done through the FreeCodeCamp online course on Scientific Computing with Python. This repository contains code snippets, resources, and mini-projects completed during the course.

## Purpose
The primary purpose of this repository is to provide guidance and assistance to fellow learners who are taking the same course. The code snippets and mini-projects included here can serve as helpful examples, offering insights into various concepts covered in the course.

## Contents
The repository is organized into the following sections:

1. **Mini Projects**: Contains code and resources for 10 mini-projects completed during the course.
2. **Certificate Projects**: Includes code and resources for 5 projects required to obtain the course certificate.
3. **Resources**: Additional helpful resources such as cheat sheets, tutorials, and references.
   
## How to Use
- Navigate to the respective directories (Mini Projects or Certificate Projects) to explore individual projects.
- Each project directory contains code files, data files (if applicable), and a README.md file explaining the purpose of the project and how to run the code.
